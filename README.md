# Time Series Forecasting

This project applies the Box-Jenkins methodology to forecast a univariate time series through ARIMA models, with extensions to handle outliers. The selected dataset contains monthly observations of the total number of tourist arrivals in Spain. 

The analysis was conducted using R, with all code and methods documented for reproducibility. 

## Methodology

The Box-Jenkins methodology is a systematic approach for modeling time series data using ARIMA models. The main steps are outlined below:
1. **Data Preprocesing** 
2. **Model Identification**   
3. **Model Estimation**
4. **Model Validation**
5. **Forecasting**
6. **Calendar Effects**
7. **Outlier Treatment**

## Project Contents

This repository includes the following components:
- **Report**: The final report summarizing the analysis, results, and conclusions following the Box-Jenkins methodology.
- **Annex**: Supplementary materials and additional figures referenced in the report. 
- **Script**: The complete R script used for preprocessing, modelling, validation and forecasting. 
- **Original Dataset**
